<h2>
    <p> shutter speed is the amount of time that the stays open when the shutter is released. when you press the shutter button on a camera a timer is set of to allow the shutter to stay open for a set period of time also known as the shutter speed. the Shutter speed is depicted but time in seconds. Typically shutters are faster than the blink of an eye and is shown as fractions of a second. FOr example: 1/1000, 1/500, 1/100, 1/50, 1/25, 1/10, 1/4, 1 second ,5 seconds, ect</p>
    <p> the longer the shutter speed, the more light is let is. Cameras generally have shutter that go up to 1/5000th of a second and can be as long as 10 seconds. A special mode is caled <em> bulb mode</em> denoted with a " <strong>B</strong>"</p>
    <p> bulb mode keeps the shutter open for aslong as you hold the shutter down, making the photographer acting as the shutter timer.

    <p> there are some important factors to consider when looking at shutter speed. firstly, the longer the shutter, the more motion blur is is introduced into the image, this can be negated by having subjects not move while the shutter is released of by speeding up the shutter to catch objects cleary while moving. for high intensity photography such as sports, it is important to use cameras with high shutterspeeds to capture the sharp images </p>

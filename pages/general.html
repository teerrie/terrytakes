    <h1>Why I Love Photography</h1>
    <h2><p>Photography is a beautiful art, as time only moves forward, photography is a way to freeze time. what I think that makes this art so beautiful is how pure it is. In general, you are not creating an image from your imagination, but capturing life as it is in a given moment. Given there are ways to manipulate the subject and scene, but in general you are simply freezeing time into a single frame </p></h2>

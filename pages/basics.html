<h2>
<p> Cameras now a days are more accessible than ever due to the shift in technology. thinking of photograpy. but to understand it fully, we need to go back to the basics</p>

<p> moving forward to the film camera, the same concept, the film that is loaded into the camera is photo sensitive material, which allows for the light to be imprinted on the film when it is exposed. But we need to be careful when contorlling the amount of light that hits the film. too much light and the film will be over exposed, effectively just capturing white.</p>
<p> to controll the amount of light there are 2 main things that can be controlled: the amount of time we let the light shine onto the film, and the size of the hole that light passes. Thus introducing Aperature and Shutter Speed</p>

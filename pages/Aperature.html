    <h1>Aperature</h1>
    <h2> <p>
        Aperature is controlling the size of the opening a camera has to let light in. this is represented by the F-stop value, commonly randing from f1.8- f20
    </p>
<p>
    An F-stop value of 1.8 is considered a "faster" lens because it has a bigger opening allowing for more light to enter. An F-stop value of 8 would be a slow lens, meaning the lens has a smaller opening letting less light in. typically, faster lenses are more exspensive than slower lenses.
</p>
<p>
    another thing to consider is that the aperature also affects depts of field and range of focus. <em>"Bokeh"</em> is term used to refer to the amount of bluring of the foreground or background compared to the subject in focus. When you think of nice portraits where somesones face is in focus, and the fest of the photo is blurry, this is bokeh.
    faster lenses allow for more bokeh. this is because the lower the f-stop value, the smaller the area of focus is. The higher the F-stop value is, the larger the range of focus is.
